# Engineering Analyses  

This repository contains Python scripts for performing various **engineering calculations and optimization tasks**. The scripts focus on computational methods used in structural and mechanical engineering, as well as optimization techniques.

## Contents  

- **`CompBolt.py`** – Performs **bolt calculations**, likely analyzing stress, load distribution, or joint integrity in bolted connections.  
- **`thesis_FA-Particle_swarm_optimisation.py`** – Implements **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**, possibly combined with another method (e.g., Firefly Algorithm), to solve engineering optimization problems.  

## Usage  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/semajrd1/Engineering-Analyses.git
   cd Engineering-Analyses
   ```
2. **Run a script**  
   ```bash
   python CompBolt.py
   ```
   Replace `CompBolt.py` with the script you want to execute.

## Dependencies  

These scripts require Python and may use libraries like `numpy`, `scipy`, or `matplotlib`. Install dependencies using:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(If a `requirements.txt` file is not included, install relevant packages manually.)*
