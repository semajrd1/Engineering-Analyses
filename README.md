# Engineering Analyses  

This repository contains Python scripts for performing various **engineering calculations and optimization tasks**. The scripts focus on computational methods used in structural and mechanical engineering, as well as optimisation techniques.

## Contents  

- **`CompBolt.py`** – Performs **pin-loading calculations** for analysing stress, load distribution, or joint integrity in pin-loaded composite connections.  
- **`FA-Particle_swarm_optimisation.py`** – Implements **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)** to solve an example engineering optimisation problem.  

## Usage  

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/semajrd1/Engineering-Analyses.git
   cd Engineering-Analyses
   ```
2. **Run a script**  
   ```bash
   python CompBolt.py
   ```
   Replace `CompBolt.py` with the script you want to execute.
